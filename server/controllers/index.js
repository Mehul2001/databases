// server/controllers/index.js defines the messages and users controllers that your application will use. Skeletons of the controllers have already been created but you'll have to write out the details for their methods

var models = require('../models');

module.exports = {
  messages: {
    get: function (req, res) {}, // a function which handles a get request for all messages
    post: function (req, res) {} // a function which handles posting a message to the database
  },

  users: {
    // Ditto as above
    get: function (req, res) {},
    post: function (req, res) {}
  }
};
